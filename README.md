# MazeCpp

This maze project is a fun way for me to brush up on new C++14 features, CMake and boost.

The code is a loose reworking of Jamis Buck's ruby examples in 'Mazes for programmers'.

At the time of writing this is purely a skeleton project. I am using TDD to build up the base classes and a simple demo app will follow soon.
