# MazeCpp

This maze project is a fun way for me to brush up on new C++14 features, CMake and boost.

The code is a loose reworking of Jamis Buck's ruby examples in 'Mazes for programmers'.

At the time of writing this is purely a skeleton project. I am using TDD to build up the base classes and a simple demo app will follow soon.

## Install

Clone or download the project, navigate to it in a terminal and run the following:
```
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
